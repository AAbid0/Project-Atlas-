The tool developed in this research project has the potential to revolutionize the way that
companies are analyzed and understood. By automating the process of clustering and labeling
similar companies based on their descriptions, the tool saves valuable time and resources for
businesses and researchers. The use of word embeddings and hierarchical clustering allows for
more accurate and nuanced grouping of companies, while the integration of natural language
processing using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 language model provides insightful and descriptive labels
for the resulting clusters. This tool could be applied to a variety of industries, such as
finance, marketing, and consulting, where analyzing large sets of companies is crucial for
decision-making. Furthermore, it has the potential to enable new types of research and
insights by facilitating the exploration of previously unconsidered connections and patterns
within the data. Ultimately, this tool represents a significant step forward in the field of
company analysis, offering a more efficient and effective way to gain valuable insights into the
landscape of businesses.
